Brooklyn Docker
===============

This project contains Brooklyn entities and examples for [Docker](http://www.docker.io).

### Getting started

This project requires a Docker instance that Brooklyn will use as a target location when deploying application blueprints. 

You can use Brooklyn to install Docker onto an existing machine, or to install Docker onto a new cloud machine with your
favourite cloud provider or cloud API.

To use the Brooklyn docker entity for installing docker on the host machine, there is an example blueprint at
[BasicInfrastructure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudsoft/brooklyn-docker/master/docker-examples/src/main/java/io/cloudsoft/docker/example/BasicInfrastructure.java)
or [docker-infrastructure.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudsoft/brooklyn-docker/master/docker-examples/src/main/assembly/files/blueprints/docker-infrastructure.yaml).
    
    % mvn clean install
    % cd docker-examples
    % mvn clean install assembly:single

    % cd target
    % tar zxvf brooklyn-docker-examples-0.2.0-dist.tar.gz
    % cd brooklyn-docker-examples-0.2.0
    % ./start.sh launch --infrastructure --location cloud

Where `cloud` can be e.g. `jclouds:softlayer`, or a named location or a fixed IP e.g. `byon:(hosts="1.2.3.4")`. Those
simple steps will give you a running docker instance on your favourite cloud.

**Important**: Please be sure that docker host allows incoming connection on TCP port *4243* (docker daemon) and on
the range *49000-49900* used by docker to map containers' ports on the host's ports. If you create a security group
on AWS called _docker_ this will be used by the application.

For more information on setting up locations, see the "Setting up Locations" section of
[Brooklyn Getting Started](http://brooklyncentral.github.io/use/guide/quickstart/index.html), and the "Off-the-shelf
Locations" section of [Brooklyn Common Usage](http://brooklyncentral.github.io/use/guide/defining-applications/common-usage.html).

Once the Docker infrastructure application has started, a new location named `docker-infrastructure` will be
available in the Locations drop-doen lost when adding new applications. Simply start a new application in this location
and it will use Docker containers instead of virtual machines.
